WebDriver
==========

This is a demo of using Selenium WebDriver + PhantomJS, and NUnit to perform a Google search, saving the HTML results as an image.

This technique is one way to write acceptance tests for web projects in NUnit, which can be used inside a Continuous Integration server.

* [Selenium Web Driver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) - Allows driving a browser natively as a user would
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) - Headless browser based on WebKit, making for faster tests
* PhantomJSDriver - Built-in WebDriver plugin to connect to PhantomJS
* [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) - Test framework that allows for assertions, and generation of output consumable by a Continuous Integration Server
